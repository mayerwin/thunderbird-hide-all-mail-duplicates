# Thunderbird Add-on: Hide Duplicates From 'All Mail'
This is a simple Thunderbird add-on that hides duplicate emails from the 'All Mail' folder upon clicking on a result from Global Search, so that if one email is in both the 'All Mail' folder (e.g. of Gmail) and another folder (e.g. 'Sent'), it'll only show the email from the other folder.
